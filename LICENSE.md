5.  **Data & Privacy.**

    A.  *Collection of Data*. Developer acknowledges and agrees that
        non-personally identifiable unique identifiers and other
        technologies may be used in connection with the performance of
        this Agreement in order to collect and use non-personally
        identifiable data from end users and their devices (“*App
        Data*”) in connection with advertisement performance, targeting,
        and end user interests (“*Performance Data*”), and to display
        Vungle Ads to end users. Developer agrees that in connection
        with Vungle Ads, Vungle may access or call to the Developer
        Apps, or the servers that make them available, and cause the
        routing, transmission, reproduction, and display of Vungle Ads
        as contemplated herein. Additionally, Developer agrees that
        Vungle may collect App Data and Performance Data, including
        unique identifiers, usage data, and streaming data, with regard
        to the Developer Apps (and included content) within which Vungle
        Ads are routed and/or served and (i) disclose such information
        to third parties (including Advertisers and
        attribution partners) as reasonably necessary in connection with
        the operation of the Vungle Platform, (ii) disclose such data if
        required by any court order, process, law or governmental
        agency; (iii) disclose such data generally when it is
        aggregated, such that the specific information relating to
        Developer is not identified as such; and (iv) use such
        information for Vungle’s internal business purposes, including
        to develop and improve the Vungle SDK and Vungle Platform.
        Vungle will collect and use the data in accordance with the
        Vungle Privacy Policy, which is available at
        [http://vungle.com/privacy/](http://vungle.com/privacy/%20) (as
        updated from time to time) and is hereby incorporated
        by reference.

    B.  *Compliance with Laws*. Developer agrees to comply with all
        Privacy Requirements (as defined below), including conspicuously
        posting a privacy policy that accurately describes the
        Developer’s and third parties’ collection, use, and disclosure
        of end user data from the Developer Apps, which include
        disclosure that third parties may collect or receive information
        and use that information to provide measurement services and
        targeted ads, and disclosure of how and where users can opt-out
        of collection and use of information for ad targeting. Developer
        will not pass any personally-identifiable information to Vungle
        unless expressly permitted in writing, and as permitted under
        any Privacy Requirements. Developer represents and warrants that
        any data Developer provides to Vungle regarding devices,
        location, or users, and the ability for Vungle to collect the
        App Data and Performance Data, is permitted and provided in
        compliance with all Privacy Requirements including Developer’s
        posted privacy policy. Developer further represents and warrants
        that it has made any and all disclosures and obtained any and
        all consents or permissions required by law with respect to
        Developer’s privacy practices, including without limitation: (a)
        any end user data Developer collects, uses, and/or
        discloses, (b) the use and disclosure of App Data and
        Performance Data to Vungle via the Vungle SDK and Vungle
        Platform, and (c) notice and parental consent required by the
        Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“*COPPA*”). Vungle
        reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate this
        Agreement should Developer violate this Section, and/or to
        remain compliant with law.

    C.  “*Privacy Requirements*” means all (i) applicable laws
        (including COPPA), governmental regulations, court or government

        users, user traffic, or otherwise relating to privacy rights,;
        and (ii) Developer’s posted privacy policy.

6.  **Developer Payments**.

<!-- -->

A.  *Developer Payment*. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
    Agreement, Vungle shall pay to Developer amounts calculated based on
    a percentage of the Net Revenue (defined below) received by Vungle
    from CPI, CPM, CPCV or CPC based IOs (the “*Developer Payment*”) for
    Vungle Ads placed in Developers App as determined by Vungle. “*Net
    Revenue*” means the gross revenue actually collected by Vungle from
    Advertisers for Vungle Ads, less (i) any refunds to
    Advertisers; (ii) a deduction of up to 10% to cover expenses related
    to Advertiser discounts, payment transaction fees,
    telecommunications, data center and other serving costs, (iii) any
    amounts payable by Vungle to providers of targeting, reporting,
    verification or other data, technology or services used in
    connection with a given campaign hereunder. The Developer Payment
    shall be based on the impression or app installation counts used by
    the applicable Advertiser(s). For the avoidance of doubt, all
    Developer Payments are based on advertisement requests from the
    Developer Apps that are actually fulfilled with Vungle Ads. All
    revenue received from activities that Vungle deems to be fraudulent
    may be refunded to the Advertiser(s) in Vungle’s sole discretion.

B.  *Payment Terms*. Vungle will pay any Developer Payment due to
    Developer 60 days after the completion of the month in which such
    campaign runs; provided that, Vungle may withhold payment until the
    following month for Developer Payment amounts less than \$50 U.S.
    Developer shall be responsible for any bank, transfer or transaction
    fees (*e.g.,* PayPal). Vungle may deduct any withholding, sales,
    value added, and other applicable taxes (other than its net
    income taxes) as required by law. Developer is responsible for
    paying any other taxes, duties, or fees for which Developer is
    legally responsible.

<!-- -->

6.  **Term and Termination.**

    A.  *Term*. This Agreement is effective until terminated in
        accordance with this Agreement.

    B.  *Termination by Vungle*. Vungle may terminate this Agreement at
        any time by providing sixty (60) days’ notice to Developer.
        Additionally, Vungle may terminate this Agreement immediately if
        Developer breaches any provision of this Agreement.

    C.  *Termination by Developer*. Developer may terminate this
        Agreement at any time by providing written notice to Vungle
        (email to suffice), ceasing all use of the Vungle Platform and
        Vungle Property, and destroying or removing from all hard
        drives, networks, and other storage media all copies of the
        Vungle Property.

    D.  *Effect of Termination*. Upon termination of this Agreement by
        Developer, the Agreement (including all rights and licenses
        granted and obligations assumed hereunder) will remain in force
        and effect until the completion of all Vungle Ad campaigns
        associated with the Developer Apps in effect on the date of such
        termination (“*Sell-Off Period*”). Vungle’s payment obligations
        will remain in effect during the Sell-Off Period. Upon any
        termination of this Agreement, each party will promptly return
        or destroy all copies of any Confidential Information in its
        possession or control. Sections 3, 7(D) through 13 shall survive
        any expiration or termination of this Agreement.

7.  **Confidentiality.**

    A.  *Definition*. “*Confidential Information*” means any and all
        business, technical and financial information or material of a
        party, whether revealed orally, visually, or in tangible or
        electronic form, that is not generally known to the public,
        which is disclosed to or made available by one party (the
        “*Disclosing Party*”) to the other, or which one party becomes
        aware of pursuant to this Agreement (the “*Receiving Party*”).
        The Vungle SDK is Vungle’s Confidential Information, and the
        terms and conditions of this Agreement shall
        remain confidential. The failure of a Disclosing Party to
        designate as “confidential” any such information or material at
        the time of disclosure shall not result in a loss of status as
        Confidential Information to the Disclosing Party. Confidential
        Information shall not include information which: (i) is in or
        has entered the public domain through no breach of this
        Agreement or other act by a Receiving Party; (ii) a Receiving
        Party rightfully knew prior to the time that it was disclosed to
        a Receiving Party hereunder; (iii) a Receiving Party received
        without restriction from a third-party lawfully possessing and
        lawfully entitled to disclose such information without breach of
        this Agreement; or (iv) was independently developed by employees
        of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information.

    B.  *Use and Disclosure Restrictions*. The Receiving Party shall not
        use the Confidential Information except as necessary to exercise
        its rights or perform its obligations under this Agreement, and
        shall not disclose the Confidential Information to any third
        party, except to those of its employees, subcontractors, and
        advisers that need to know such Confidential Information for the
        purposes of this Agreement, provided that each such employee,
        subcontractor, and advisor is subject to a written agreement
        that includes binding use and disclosure restrictions that are
        at least as protective of the Confidential Information as those
        set forth herein. The Receiving Party will use at least the
        efforts such party ordinarily uses with respect to its own confidential
        information of similar nature and importance to maintain the
        confidentiality of all Confidential Information in its
        possession or control, but in no event less than
        reasonable efforts. The foregoing obligations will not restrict
        the Receiving Party from disclosing any Confidential Information
        required by applicable law; provided that, the Receiving Party
        must use reasonable efforts to give the Disclosing Party advance
        notice thereof (*i.e.,* so as to afford Disclosing Party an
        opportunity to intervene and seek an order or other relief for
        protecting its Confidential Information from any unauthorized
        use or disclosure) and the Confidential Information is only
        disclosed to the extent required by law. The Receiving Party
        shall return all of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential
        Information to the Disclosing Party or destroy the same, no
        later than fifteen (15) days after Disclosing Party’s request,
        or when Receiving Party no longer needs Confidential Information
        for its authorized purposes hereunder.

8.  **Representations and Warranties of Developer**. Developer
    represents, warrants and covenants to Vungle that: (a) it has all
    necessary rights, title, and interest in and to the Developer Apps,
    and it has obtained all necessary rights, releases, and permissions
    to grant the rights granted to Vungle in this Agreement, including
    to allow Vungle to sell and insert the Vungle Ads as contemplated
    herein; (b) it shall not use the Vungle Platform to collect or
    discern any personally identifiable information of end users, or use
    the data received through the Vungle Platform to re-identify an
    individual; and (c) the Developer Apps will comply with the
    Developer Apps Content Policy, and will not infringe upon, violate,
    or misappropriate any third party right, including any intellectual
    property, privacy, or publicity rights.

9.  **Warranty Disclaimer**. The Vungle SDK and Vungle Platform are
    provided “As Is”. VUNGLE DOES NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS,
    IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, including but not limited to
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE
    OF DEALING OR PERFORMANCE. VUNGLE AND ITS SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, AND
    PARTNERS DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE VUNGLE PLATFORM OR VUNGLE SDK WILL
    BE CORRECT, UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE
    CORRECTED, OR THAT THE VUNGLE PLATFORM OR VUNGLE SDK ARE FREE OF
    VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. VUNGLE DOES NOT WARRANT THE
    RESULTS OF USE OF THE VUNGLE PLATFORM OR VUNGLE SDK. DEVELOPER
    ACKNOWLEDGES THAT VUNGLE MAY MODIFY OR SUSPEND THE VUNGLE PLATFORM
    AT ANY TIME IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION AND WITHOUT NOTICE.

10. **Indemnification**.

    A.  *Developer Indemnification*. Developer agrees to indemnify,
        defend, and hold harmless Vungle and its affiliates, and their
        directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any
        liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable
        attorneys’ fees) arising out of any claim, demand, action, or
        proceeding initiated by a third party arising from or in
        connection with any breach of Developer’s obligations,
        representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement;
        provided that, Vungle: (a) promptly notifies Developer in
        writing of the claim, except that any failure to provide this
        notice promptly only relieves Developer of its responsibility to
        the extent its defense is materially prejudiced by the
        delay; (b) grants Developer sole control of the defense and/or
        settlement of the claim; and (c) reasonably cooperates with
        Developer in connection with such claim at Developer’s cost
        and expense.

    B.  *Vungle Indemnification*. Vungle agrees to indemnify, reimburse
        and hold harmless, Developer, its officers, directors,
        employees, and agents from and against any and all third party
        claims, liabilities, demands, causes of action, damages, losses
        and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
        attorneys' fees and costs of suit, arising out of or in
        connection with Vungle’s infringement or misappropriation of a
        third party U.S. copyright, trademark or trade secret by the use
        of the Vungle Platform and/or the Vungle SDK by Developer as
        permitted hereunder; provided that, Developer: (a) promptly
        notifies Vungle in writing of the claim, except that any failure
        to provide this notice promptly only relieves Vungle of its
        responsibility to the extent its defense is materially
        prejudiced by the delay; (b) grants Vungle sole control of the
        defense and/or settlement of the claim; and (c) reasonably
        cooperates with Vungle in connection with such claim at Vungle’s
        cost and expense. In addition, if the use of the Vungle Property
        by Developer has become, or in Vungle’s opinion is likely to
        become, the subject of any claim of infringement, Vungle may at
        its option and expense (i) procure for Developer the right to
        continue using the Vungle Property as set forth hereunder; (ii)
        replace or modify the Vungle Property to make it non-infringing
        so long as the Vungle Property has substantially equivalent
        functionality; or (iii) if options (i) or (ii) are not
        reasonably practicable, terminate this Agreement. Vungle shall
        have no liability or obligation under this Section with respect
        to any claim if such claim is caused in whole or in part by (x)
        compliance with designs, data, instructions, or specifications
        provided by Developer; (y) modification of the Vungle Property
        by any party other than Vungle without Vungle’s express consent;
        or (z) the combination, operation, or use of the Vungle Property
        with other applications, portions of applications, product(s),
        data or services where the Vungle Property would not by itself
        be infringing unless Vungle has required or expressly allowed
        such combination, operation, or use. The indemnification rights
        contained in this Section 11 are Developer’s sole remedy for
        third party infringement claims relating to Vungle’s SDK and the
        Vungle Platform.

11. **Limitation of Liability**. EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO INDEMNIFICATION
    OBLIGATIONS HEREIN and Breaches of Section 2 (Vungle SDK License),
    NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO OTHER PARTY FOR ANY PUNITIVE,
    INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, RELIANCE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
    INCLUDING LOST BUSINESS, DATA, REVENUE, OR ANTICIPATED PROFITS,
    WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR
    OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT a party WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
    OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGES. EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO INDEMNIFICATION
    OBLIGATIONS HEREIN and Breaches of Section 2 (Vungle SDK License),
    IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS
    AGREEMENT EXCEED THE TOTAL Developer Payment PAYABLE TO DEVELOPER
    UNDER THIS AGREEMENT by Vungle in the twelve (12) month period
    immediately preceding the date of the claim.

12. **General.**

        of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and each
        provision, or portion thereof, is hereby declared to be
        separate, severable, and distinct.
